## Scope

Security considerations for scip-cli include:

- **Index integrity**: SCIP indexes are read from local filesystem and trusted
- **SQL injection**: All queries use parameterized statements
- **Path traversal**: File operations are scoped to the indexed project
- **Dependency security**: Stdlib + `modernc.org/sqlite`; versions pinned in `go.mod`

## Security Best Practices for Users

- Build from source or install a verified release binary
- Keep scip-cli updated to the latest version
- Review `.scip-cli.json` configuration before use in untrusted projects
- The `scip` binary is downloaded from [official releases](https://github.com/scip-code/scip/releases)

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you to understand and address the issue promptly.
